this work; she is too selfless to accept that she should be a co-author
of this technical report, even though it was our intent to include her as such.
We also thank Eric Phipps and Shaden Smith for their guidance on
running the software packages Genten and SPLATT, respectively.
And we thank Eric Phipps, Chris Siefert, Rich Vuduc, and Jeff Young for
